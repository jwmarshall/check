# Check

A simple (for now?) docker health check command written in golang.

To Do Maybe?:
- Accept docker secret files for some arguments (e.g. username, password)
- Regex content checks for http
- Common header checks for http (e.g. Location, etc)
- Other common services (e.g. Mysql, Redis)
- File (e.g. exists, owner, group, permissions)
